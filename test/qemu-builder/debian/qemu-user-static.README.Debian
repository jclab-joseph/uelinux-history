Historically, there were different naming in use for the
same architectures within different groups/projects.  For
example, amd64 architecture (Debian name) is also known as
x86_64; arm64 and aarch64; and so on.  Qemu used one way
to name the binaries, debian used another, some architectures
are named the same way, while for other architectures there's
a difference.

Starting with debian qemu-user-static package version 8.0, we
provide debian-compatible naming scheme for qemu-$arch-static
binaries, to be used as qemu-${DEB_HOST_ARCH}-static.  For
example, qemu-armel-static is a symlink for qemu-arm-static.

In particular, the following extra names are provided:

  amd64 => x86_64
  arm64 => aarch64
  armhf => arm
  armel => arm
  loong64 => loongarch64
  powerpc => ppc
  ppc64el => ppc64

The other names do match between qemu and debian.

There's another name which is also provided but which is
neither in debian nor in qemu: it is ppc64le, which is
the name used for this architecture in the linux kernel.
